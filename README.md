# Machine Learning 
The Machine Learning (Python) course teaches the basics of machine learning and how to use industry standard Python libraries. Students will learn to pre-process data, the differences between various algorithms, and ways to validate a model. The differences between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement algorithms will be detailed, as well as the appropriate uses of each. The course also introduces students to complications that arise when interpreting the output of a machine learning model. Students who complete this course are able to find solutions to a range of challenges faced in predictive data analysis using machine learning.
## Objectives:
- Demonstrate knowledge of the differences between major machine learning algorithms.
- Demonstrate proficiency with Python to pre-process data to prepare for use in machine learning.
- Train multiple machine learning models using real-world data.
- Demonstrate accepted methods of model validation.
- Utilize machine learning algorithms to process data for pattern and problem detection.
